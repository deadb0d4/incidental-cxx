# Goal

Project to implement and test useless yet fun algorithms in (hopefully) modern c++.

# Platforms

It is built and tested on macOS. It probably should be fine as long as one's compiler supports concepts and coroutines.

# Roadmap

- [x] routine ops
- [x] git
- [x] git repo
- [x] no buffer mergesort
- [x] closest points
- [ ] viz. tool (another repo + wrapper)
- [ ] splay tree
- [ ] link-cut
- [ ] dynamic connectivity
- [ ] constrained programming
- [ ] simplex method
